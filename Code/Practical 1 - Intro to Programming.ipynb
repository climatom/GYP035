    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first 'programming' session, we will begin by addressing how to use these Ipython notebooks, and will then dive straight in to write our first code -- dealing with fundamental concepts in python, including: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable assignment\n",
    "- Attributes and functions\n",
    "- Loops\n",
    "- Indexing\n",
    "- Conditional statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The above list probably doesn't mean an awful lot right now, but bear with me and it should by the end of the session. Before getting in to the detail below, I should point out that I expect all of this to be new to you, so please do ask if you are unsure (that's normal!) -- I will do my best to fill in the gaps. Also, whilst following these guides will get you to where you need to be for the assessment, I should emphasise that they will not make you skilled programmers; that comes with time and patience, and a lot of practice -- and I encourage you to continue your programming efforts beyond this course if that is a direction you want your career to follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using this \"notebook\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are made of 'cells' -- which either contain text (like this one) or code. Those cells with code incan be 'run' in a variety of ways - the simplest is to hold the 'ctrl' key and press 'enter'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, within code cells, I can have text that won't instruct the computer to do anything -- so long as I 'hide' that text behind the '#' character -- which indicates that text should be interpreted as a comment, $\\it{not}$ as code. In these notebooks I will use comments to provide clarity over some code, and use these text blocks (like the one you are reading) to provide more detailed explanations and instructions.  \n",

    "We're going to begin with a bit of a programming tradition -- getting the computer to say hello. \n",

At its simplest (which is a good place to start), we 'index' an iterable (like a list) using the square brackets -> [ ] to indicate which position we want to access.
